# ASP.NET Core Front-end + 2 Back-end APIs on Azure Container Apps

This repository contains a simple scenario built to demonstrate how ASP.NET Core 6.0 can be used to build a cloud-native application hosted in Azure Container Apps. The repository consists of the following projects and folders:

* Catalog API - this is an ASP.NET minimal API project with one endpoint. 
* Orders API - this is an ASP.NET minimal API project with one endpoint. 
* UI - an ASP.NET Blazor Server app that calls out to both the Catalog and Orders API and renders their status.
* ```tye.yaml```  - this file defines microservices that can be run easily on local development machine using `tye run` command
* ```deploy``` folder - this folder contains a series of [Azure Bicep](http://aka.ms/bicep) templates that can be used to create the application and deploy it.
* ```setup.ps1``` - this file is a one-stop way for you to deploy the app to your own Azure subscription so you can try the scenario. 

## Prerequisites

* .NET 6.0
* The Azure CLI
* An Azure subscription
* Docker
* PowerShell *(GitHub Actions will replace this prerequisite soon)*
* [Dapr](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/)
* [Tye](https://github.com/dotnet/tye/blob/main/docs/getting_started.md) (optional, recommended)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. From root of this repo, run on local machine with `tye run`.  Test url is http://localhost:5213.  Tye dasbboard is http://localhost:8000.  
3. View Zipkin observability and tracing on http://localhost:9411 
4. Sign in to your Azure subscription using the `az login` command.
5. If you have more than 1 Azure subscription, make sure you're targeting the *right* Azure subscription by using the `az account show` and `az account set -s <subscription-id>` commands.
6. From the root of this repo, run `./setup.ps1`. 

## Topology diagram

The resultant application is an Azure Container Environment-hosted set of containers - the `catalog` API, the `orders` API, and the `frontend` Razor Pages front-end.

Internet traffic should not be able to directly access either of the back-end APIs as each of these containers is marked as "internal ingress only" during the deployment phase. Internet traffic hitting the `frontend.<your app>.<your region>.azurecontainerapps.io` URL should be proxied to the `frontend` container, which in turn makes outbound calls to both the `catalog` and `orders` APIs within the Azure Container Apps Environment.
